Welcome to my repo for **STATS220**! My name is Natasha Munn and I am majoring in Statistics. My love of statistics stems from:
1. A strong interest in investigating and finding answers, *even when we least expect them!*
2. A love of studying and understanding the world around me through data

I will be using this repo any *any code or files* related to my STATS220 projects💻
